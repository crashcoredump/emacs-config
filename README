# How to bootstrap a fresh Emacs install
========================================

emacs -l ~/elisp/bootstrap.el

This will make sure ELPA & MELPA are initialised, and will fetch
Pallet & Cask to do the rest of dependency management. After it's done
(give it a few moments to download and compile things), close emacs
and start it again:

emacs --eval "(cask-install)"

This will do the actual fetching of the packages your Cask manifest
specifies (and will probably take a while). Afterwards, you can close
emacs and start it normally.

# It installed Pallet, but compilation said "Cannot open load file cask"
=======================================================================

Yeah, it does that. Doesn't seem to matter though.
