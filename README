# How to bootstrap a fresh Emacs install
========================================

emacs -l ~/elisp/bootstrap.el

This will make sure ELPA & MELPA are initialised, and will fetch
Pallet & Cask to do the rest of dependency management. After it's
done, close emacs and start it normally

# It installed Pallet, but compilation said "Cannot open load file cask"
=======================================================================

Yeah, it does that. Doesn't seem to matter though.
